	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Large-scale convective flows called giant cells were once thought to transport the Sun’s luminosity in the solar convection zone, but recent observations have called their existence into question. In place of large-scale flows, some authors have suggested the solar luminosity may instead be transported by small droplets of rapidly falling, low-entropy fluid. This “entropy rain” could propagate as dense vortex rings, analogous to rising buoyant thermals in the Earth’s atmosphere. In this work, we develop an analytical theory describing the evolution of dense, negatively buoyant thermals. We verify the theory with 2D cylindrical and 3D Cartesian simulations of laminar, axisymmetric thermals in highly stratified atmospheres. Our results show that dense thermals fall in two categories: a stalling regime in which the droplets slow down and expand, and a falling regime in which the droplets accelerate and shrink as they propagate downwards. We estimate that solar downflows are in the falling regime and maintain their entropy perturbation against diffusion until they reach the base of the convection zone. This suggests that entropy rain may be an effective nonlocal mechanism for transporting the solar luminosity.}

The code expands tensorial variables in a spectral series of spin-weighted spherical harmonics in the angular directions and a scaled Jacobi polynomial basis in the radial direction, as described in Vasil et al. (2018; hereafter, Part-I). Nonlinear terms are calculated by transforming from the coefficients of the spectral series to the value of each quantity on the physical grid, where it is easy to calculate products and perform other local operations. The expansion makes it straightforward to solve equations in tensor form (i.e., without decomposition into scalars). We propose and study several unit tests which demonstrate the code can accurately solve linear problems, implement boundary conditions, and transform between spectral and physical space. We then run a series of benchmark problems proposed in Marti et al. (2014), implementing the hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic equations. We are able to calculate more accurate solutions than reported in Marti et al. (2014) by running at higher spatial resolution and using a higher-order timestepping scheme. We find the rotating convection and convective dynamo benchmark problems depend sensitively on details of timestepping and data analysis. We also demonstrate that in low resolution simulations of the dynamo problem, small changes in a numerical scheme can lead to large changes in the solution. To aid future comparison to these benchmarks, we include the source code used to generate the data, as well as the data and analysis scripts used to generate the figures."

    abstract = { AbstractEntrainment in cumulus convection remains ill-understood and difficult to quantify. For instance, entrainment is widely believed to be a fundamentally turbulent process, even though Turner (1957) pointed out that dry thermals entrain primarily because of buoyancy (via a dynamical constraint requiring an increase in radius r). Furthermore, entrainment has been postulated to obey a 1/r scaling, but this scaling has not been firmly established.Here, we study the classic case of dry thermals in a neutrally stratified environment using fully resolved direct numerical simulation. We combine this with a thermal tracking algorithm which defines a control volume for the thermal at each time, allowing us to directly measure entrainment. We vary the Reynolds number Re of our thermals between laminar (Re ≈ 600) and turbulent (Re ≈ 6000) regimes, finding only a 20\% variation in entrainment rate ɛ, supporting the claim that turbulence is not necessary for entrainment. We also directly verify the postulated ε ~ 1/r scaling law. }

These are instructional methods that are based on, assessed by, and validated through research on the teaching and learning of physics. They involve students in their own learning more deeply and more intensely than does traditional instruction, particularly during class time. The instructional methods and supporting body of research reviewed here offer potential for significantly improved learning in comparison to traditional lecture-based methods of college and university physics instruction. We begin with an introduction to the history of active learning in physics in the United States, and then discuss some methods for and outcomes of assessing pedagogical effectiveness. We enumerate and describe common characteristics of successful active-learning instructional strategies in physics. We then discuss a range of methods for introducing active-learning instruction in physics and provide references to those methods for which there is published documentation of student learning gains.",

In this work, we analyze the Kepler long-cadence data of 26,521 main-sequence stars of spectral types M and K in order to measure their surface rotation and photometric activity level. Rotation-period estimates are obtained by the combination of a wavelet analysis and autocorrelation function of the light curves. Reliable rotation estimates are determined by comparing the results from the different rotation diagnostics and four data sets. We also measure the photometric activity proxy  using the amplitude of the flux variations on an appropriate timescale. We report rotation periods and photometric activity proxies for about 60% of the sample, including 4431 targets for which McQuillan et al. did not report a rotation period. For the common targets with rotation estimates in this study and in McQuillan et al., our rotation periods agree within 99%. In this work, we also identify potential polluters, such as misclassified red giants and classical pulsator candidates. Within the parameter range we study, there is a mild tendency for hotter stars to have shorter rotation periods. The photometric activity proxy spans a wider range of values with increasing effective temperature. The rotation period and photometric activity proxy are also related, with  being larger for fast rotators. Similar to McQuillan et al., we find a bimodal distribution of rotation periods.}

abstract="We investigated and compared the learning environment perceptions of students, teachers and guides who participated in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)-based outreach activities in secondary education. In outreach activities, schools and teachers work together with companies and other external institutions in learning activities in order to motivate students for the STEM domain. In this study, we identified characteristics of outreach activities that explain variance in perceptions of students. Data were gathered from 729 high-school students as well as 35 teachers and guides in 12 activities both in the US and the Netherlands. A questionnaire was used to asses outreach activities based on subscales from validated questionnaires such as the What Is Happening In this Classroom, Constructivist Learning Environments Survey, Classroom Environment Scale and the Learning Climate Questionnaire. Teachers' perceptions were more positive than students' perceptions for most scales, while guides perceived the outreach learning environment in almost the same way as students. Student perceptions were very positive for outreach activities. Outreach activity characteristics such as teaching method and emphasis were found to be the most important factors in explaining variance in students' perceptions between activities. Long-term problem-based activities and the perspective of new views of science and scientists were perceived as providing the most positive learning environments. Additionally, outreach learning environments can create opportunities to increase students' motivation in STEM.",
