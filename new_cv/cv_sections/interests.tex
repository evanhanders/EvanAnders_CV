\section{Research Interests}

%Computational fluid dynamics and its applications to stellar interiors and atmospheres. \\
%Convection and its interactions with stably-stratified layers, rotation, and magnetism.

Former astrophysical fluid dynamicist now studying AI safety and alignment.
My current research in Mechanistic Interpretability uses toy models and state-of-the-art language models to study how features are stored together in superposition within models.
